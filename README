This dataset consists of raw 18-channel EEG and functional near infrareds(fNIRS) from 7 human paticipants with orthopedic Impairment during motor imagery(MI).  The participants performed a series of MI-related trials across three sessions. These sessions comprised 40 trials, of which four different MI tasks were presented in random order (e.g., Reach → Twist → Lift → Reach → Grasp → Grasp → Twist → Reach → Lift → Reach). Each trial began with 3 s of fixation cross. The monitor then displayed a 4 s visual cue, followed by 3 s of letters indicating the ready state with a gray screen to eliminate the afterimage. The participants were then instructed to perform the imaginary movement for 5 s in the given order.
